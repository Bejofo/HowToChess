One player is assigned the white pieces pieces and one player is assigned the black pieces.

Each turn the players get to move one of their pieces. The white pieces always goes first.

The goal of the game is place the opptent king into "checkmate", a situation where the king cannot avoid capture.
## 2. Know the pieces
The start of each game you start with 16 pieces. 8 pawns, 2 knights, 2 bishops, 2 rooks, 1 queen and 1 king.

### Pawns
Pawns a bit unique, they normally are only allowed to either move one square forward if the spot is empty, or they can move digaonlly one spot forward only if  this moves results in capture.

There is one important exception for the pawn, they are allowed to move
two spaces on the first turn they are moved.

Pawns are also subject to En passant, which is covered later.

### Knights
Knights move in a L shape. 2 tiles in on of the 4 cardinal direcction, and one tile to the side.

Knights are unique in that they are  the only piece that can "jump over" other
pieces.

### Bishop
Bishops move any amount of tiles diagnonally. However they cannot "jump over"
any pieces.

It's important to note that a bishop that starts a dark squares, is unable
to ever reach a light square, and a bishop that starts on light square 
is unable to reach a dark square. This means that Bishops are usually valued
less than rooks.
### Rook
Rooks are similar to bishops, and can move any amount of tiles orthogonally

### Queen
The queen is most powerful piece, it can act as either a rook or a bishop. 

### King
The most important piece. If this piece gets checkmated, you lose the game.
Movement is simple, the king can move 1 tile in any of the 8 directions.

## 3. Common misconceptions
### Stalemate
If player has no legal moves to play, this is called a stalemate.
Important, stalemates result in a draw, __not__ a loss for the player
unable to move. When performing checkmates, it important not accidentally
stalemate and cause a draw.
### En passant
If a pawns move two squares on it first move, it's still possible to capture
it as if it had only moved a single square. However this is only possible immdiately after the pawn move. If you don't perform En passant the turn after, you miss the opportunity.

### Castling
You can't castle if you have moved the king, or you have moved the rook 
involved. You also can't castle if doing so would place your king in check or __any of the squares in between is being attacked__


## 3. Opening
The first few moves played in a chess games is called the opening,
this is where players attempt cement a favorable position for most
of the game.

There are some well known openings, a spefic sequnce of opening moves 
are also something called a line.

At the beginner level, the exact choice of opening rarely matters.
It's better to focus on some basisc principles rather than memorizing
opening lines.

- Move your pieces into 'active' positions. 
- King safety, move your king away from danger. (Often done by castling)
- Control as much space as possible.

## 4. Midgame (Tactics)
There are few important concepts that show up in chess. While knowing the
names of these concepts are not important, being able to recognize these
situations it quite useful.

### Pin
A pieces is "pinned" is moving it would expose another piece to attack.

### Fork
A fork occurs when a piece is attacking two pieces at once. Forks are useful since it is very diffcult to simatulous protect both attacked pieces in a single move.

### Overload
A piece is overloaded if it serving two purposes at once. Overloaded pieces,
can often give the illusion of being able to two defend two pieces at once, when in reality is only able to defend one or another.

## 5. Endgame
There are some combination of pieces which are known to be able to 
force a checkmate, and there are some combinations which cannot.

For examples, a rook and king can guarantee a checkmate against a lone king,
however a knight and king cannot.
